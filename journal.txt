# Abbrev. typo
Originally, we thought there are several states with just a few observations,
but after searching for those abbreviations, I believe they are typos. Thus,
during deed_prep, instead of using SITUS_STATE (abbrev), I now use the first two 
digits of FIPS (the states' fips) to group the data.
